# H_Spectrum_SOC_SynData
This project aims to generate realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic patient data using generative models like VAEs and GANs. The synthetic data mimics real-world healthcare datasets such as UCI Diabetes or SEER Cancer data, allowing researchers and developers to build and test machine learning models without compromising patient privacy.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals
- Build generative models (VAE, CTGAN, etc.) to synthesize patient records
- Evaluate data fidelity, utility, and privacy risk
- Provide synthetic datasets for safe research and education
- (Optional) Build a simple UI to generate and visualize synthetic data

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Customizable synthetic patient profile generation
- Distribution and privacy evaluation reports
- Streamlit/Flask UI for hands-on interaction
- Open-source and reproducible

---

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Python  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow  
- SDV (Synthetic Data Vault)  
- Streamlit / Flask (for UI)  
- Git & GitHub
